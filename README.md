# PortScanner

As I fully begin my journey and I start to immerse myself into the cyber security and ethical hacking world, I introduce my first bit of code in that department. 

Previously I did general coding and overall projects just to get the hang of programming and master the basics. Now is where I specialize.

And so, I introduce to you a simple port scanner written in Python.

Input an IP Address or IP Addresses (seprated by a comma) and then the number of ports for said Address(es) that you wish to scan.

The socket library in Python is used to establish connection.

The results will print/show the open ports of the target(s).
